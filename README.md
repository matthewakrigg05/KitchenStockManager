This project is one that I have chosen to do to transfer my knowledge from other languages, such as Java, and 
learn C# from it - in a hands on manner. The aim of this project is to create a kitchen/restaurant management system.
In it you should be able to do the following:
- [ ] Add/Remove ingredients
- [ ] Create recipes and dishes
- [ ] Create menus, with names and descriptions so they can be passed to menu design staff
- [ ] Manage inventory in a controlled fashion
- [ ] Create lists for orders to be placed/that have been placed
- [ ] Create prep lists and have them assigned to staff (specifically kitchen staff)
- [ ] Store supplier information so they are easy to contact regarding orders
	
Then, in the future, I intend to make it possible to use analytical tools that enable the user to view trends
in dishes that have been sold, ingredients used, popularity of certain dishes. Furthermore, I have ambitions to 
implement an AI solution that can learn these trends and ensure that kitchens don't over or under order stock,
depending on the days of the week or the season.

As mentioned, this is being developed in C# and uses the MVVM framework, as I intend for this application to be deployable 
to Mac and Windows, with the option in the future to expand the project to iOS and android! I am also making a conscious
effort to implement appropriate unit testing, ideally, writing my unit tests before I write the methods that I am 
testing.
